        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The U.S. Network for Democracy in Brazil (USNDB) is a decentralized, democratic, non-partisan national network focused on educating the U.S public about Brazil and defending progressive social change.
            </p>
            <p>I led a project to redesign the network's website as a part of the NGO's rebrand.  My role was to lead the team through the phases of the design process, establish our design system, and partner cross-functionally on strategy and implementation. As the project is still in progress, this case study focuses primarily on the finished home page.</p>

             <h3>Defining Goals</h3>
             <p>In order to revamp the network's identity, I defined concrete objectives with my supervisor and team, including: create a new digital design system to reflect our new brand identity and rethink the narrative of key pages of the website based off an expanded audience.

         <h3>Task Analysis: What Should We Change?</h3>
         <p>To understand what proved effective and ineffective from the previous website iteration <a href="http://democracybrazil.org">(democracybrazil.org)</a>, I had four individuals complete a task analysis exercise. In this exercise, the participants
         navigated the original site and followed directions to try and access certain information. Below are some key insights from the exercise:</p>

               <h2>Determining Deliverables</h2>
               <p>Based on the insights gleaned from the task analysis exercise, I collaborated with my team (consisting of my manager, a web content editor, and a social media manager) to
                 narrow down our previous goals into deliverable steps.</p>
               <p><strong>1. Reorganize how information is displayed.</strong><br> We needed to move away from
                 relying on a slider to instead establishing a logical heirarchy of information on the home page.</p>
               <p><strong>2. Incorporate more imagery and kill needless space.</strong><br>Users had trouble differentiating
                 unique website sections because of the sections' similarity and unintentional cohesion. Images and effective use of whitespace
                 could counter these issues.
               </p>
               <p><strong>3. Refresh the branding identity.</strong><br>In order to reach a more diverse audience, the Network required an overall
                 revamp of graphical components, colors, typography, and logo.

         <h2>Early prototyping and wireframes</h2>
         <p>Before considering visual design, I defined the UX and information architecture of the website. These decisions helped inform some key navigational elements, such as the features section and news feed. With that foundation in place, I had the tools and means to explore the narrative and user experience of individual pages through wireframing.</p>

                  <h2>Design System</h2>
                  <p>I next began exploring the visual design of our new brandâ€™s website. While the major elements of our new brand were defined (color, typograpghy, and logo) there was still ample room to define how they worked together in an interactive environment. Throughout this exploratory phase, I documented our nascent design system in Figma and worked to ensure that elements were consistent across the entire page.

            <h2>Takeaways & Moving Forward</h2>
            <p><strong>1. Next steps.</strong> After implementing the home page, next deliverable tasks include prototyping and designing pages for the network's profile, the U.S. Observatory's profile, and membership. I'm currently working on these tasks and will finish them by the end of this upcoming semester.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Reflections.</strong> Working on this project was a privilege as I had the chance to actively contribute to and work with a network of premiere Brazilian scholars, artists, activists, and leaders on creating a brand that resonates and reflects the pursuit of democratic values. Through this project I am
            constantly challenged to consider how I might take a high-level and important topic like democracy and effectively diffuse it into media and design elements.  </p>
