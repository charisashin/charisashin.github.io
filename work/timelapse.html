        <div>
            <p>How can we grow in awareness of how we track our time when we're too busy to even remember what happens in a day?
              At this moment, pursuing such a goal would require consistent logging, patience, and discipline.
            </p>
            <p>Timelapse is an integrated mobile and smartwatch application that helps people keep track of how they spend their time on a daily basis.
              It was inspired by late-night conversations with friends about feeling that time was slipping away, without knowing where that time was being spent.

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>It’s easy to get through the day without fully understanding where time is being allocated. Larger events might be easier to keep track of, but smaller activities and distractions are difficult to pinpoint. In fact, manually keeping track of every detail of the day proves counter-productive and frustrating.
           <strong>Is there a way to automatically keep track of how people spend their time, to enhance productivity and wellbeing? </strong>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>Qualitative Interviews</h3>
        <p>In order to understand the current pain points surrounding time-tracking, I conducted <strong>30+ informal interviews</strong> with potential users between the ages of 15-60,
          structuring the questions to revolve around current time usage, time tracking methods, and hurdles in the time-tracking process.

            <p><strong>92% of users expressed that they thought they were not maximizing their time.</strong> Users often overestimate their working hours and
                underestimate the time they spend on leisure activities.
                Reviewing the graph revealed distractions during work.</p>

            <p><strong>Manual time-tracking is painful. </strong>Users would be prone to feeling

            <p><strong>Simple visuals are more effective than pure data.</strong> Users want to see exactly what they're spending their time on but also need accessibility, so simple visuals work much better than complex, unorganized data.

        <h3>Looking at other existing solutions</h3>
        <p>To see what already existed in addressing the productivity problem, I researched other
        time-tracking applications, what did they well, and what could be improved. I discovered that many apps
        focused on time-tracking in a strictly statistical manner, which could be difficult to use to shed light on a user's daily habits.

        <h3>Centralizing Time</h3>
        <p>So how could I help users understand their time usage in an automated way? After reading productivity forums and having additional informal
          conversations with potential users, I came to realize that in such a technological age, our devices are a window to how we spend our time&mdash;past,
          present, and future.

        <h2>Protoyping</h2>
        <h3>Events, Behaviors and Activities</h3>
        <p> We have so many applications on our phone already. Each app can provide automatic insight into what activities we complete and how we spend our time. I came up with the idea of
            defining a time-assessment system composed of three layers: Events, Behaviors, and Activities.
          </p>
          <p>These layers help the user from becoming overwhelmed by an influx of data and give them the autonomy to determine how much information they want to see at a time. Only want a high-level view?
          Choose to look only at Events. Want the specifics? Dive into Behaviors or Activities.</p>

        <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
        <p>Based on the time-assessment system, I constructed the user flow to represented what a user's journey might look like. Because the application
          would be generating a significant amount of data, I wanted to keep the flow as simple and streamlined as possible.

        <h3>Wireframing & Low-Fidelity Mocks</h3>
        <p>To automatically present information on productivity, sleep, fitness, distractions, and memorable
            moments captured during the day, I designed "highlights". Highlights are basically snapshots to help
            the user view their time spent through the usage of various apps. I centered the highlights around a card model, because of its
            intuitive nature. Cards are great for quickly communicating information and they allow users to easily access information that <i>they</i>
            are interested in.
            <br><br>
            Also, cards as content containers are easy to manipulate for responsive and mobile design, and also address issues of scalability, which allows for seamless handoff to engineers for development.

            <p> Colors and visual design elements were chosen with color-blind users specifically in mind since color acts as an important element of organization and affordance in this app. I made sure to use software tools to simulate colorblindness and ensure enough contrast, following WCAG 2.0 standards.

        <div class="center">
            <h2>Takeaways & Moving Forward</h2>
            <p><strong>1. Designing across platforms.</strong> This project taught me about how to best represent
              data and time across varying devices. Designing for a smartwatch was definitely a new experience
              for me in terms of formatting and prototyping.

               </p>
            <p><strong>2. Time realization.</strong> Through this design exercise, I realized how much time
            people spend on their electronic devices in a day and the designer's ethical obligation of encouraging users to
            spend more time off their devices. Quantifying the time spent can help people
           figure out how to better allocate their time. </p>
           <p><strong>3. Further improvements.</strong> Based on the ethical consideration of encouraging time spent offscreen, I would love to implement a goal system to help the user adjust how they currently use their time and accomplish certain goals (i.e. spend 30 mins max. on social media).
