        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div>
            <p>“Quantifying everyday life” refers to tracking daily activities to further
                self-awareness, and improve productivity, health, and work-life balance. However, it requires
                consistent logging, patience, and discipline.
            </p>
            <p>Timelapse is an integrated mobile and smartwatch application that helps people keep track of how they spend their time on a daily basis.
              It was inspired by late-night conversations with friends about feeling that time was slipping away, without knowing where that time was being spent.

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>With the rise of smartwatches, I grew fascinated by their unique features -- specifically
          their ability to track and measure personal milestones from the day, including steps walked,
          heart-rate, sleeping quality, etc.
        </p>

        <p>I wanted to see if there was a streamlined solution that would allow for users to skip
        the arduous task of manually logging activities and behaviors by instead relying solely on a smartwatch
        for automated recording. </p>

            <h3>The Book: Strange Life</h3>
            <p>The Russian scientist Aleksandr Lyubishchev created a time-recording method in 1916, which
             he used to document 56 years of his life with pen and paper. His biography espouses the benefits and
             methodology behind tracking the hours of the day and how we spend them.</p>

            <h3>Insights</h3>
            <p><strong>The timeline unveils user patterns.</strong> Users often overestimate their working hours and
                underestimate the time they spend on leisure activities.
                Reviewing the graph revealed distractions during work.</p>

            <p><strong>Manual time-tracking is painful. </strong>Users would be prone to feeling
            frustrated if they forgot to log their time, or even tempted to quit the exercise.</p>
            <p><strong>Simple visuals are more effective than pure data.</strong> Users want to see exactly what they're spending their time on but also need accessibility, so simple visuals work much better than complex, unorganized data.

        <h3>Events, Behaviors and Activities</h3>
        <p> We have so many applications on our phone already. Each app can provide automatic insight into what activities we complete and how we spend our time. I came up with the idea of
            defining a time-assessment system composed of three layers: Events, Behaviors, and Activities.

            moments.

        <div class="center">
            <h2>Takeaways & Moving Forward</h2>
            <p><strong>1. Designing across platforms.</strong> This project taught me about how to best represent
              data and time across varying devices. Designing for a smartwatch was definitely a new experience
              for me in terms of formatting and prototyping.

               </p>
            <p><strong>2. Time realization.</strong> Through this design exercise, I realized how much time
            people spend on their electronic devices in a day and the designer's ethical obligation of encouraging users to
            spend more time off their devices. Quantifying the time spent can help people
           figure out how to better allocate their time. </p>
           <p><strong>3. Further improvements.</strong> Based on the ethical consideration of encouraging time spent offscreen, I would love to implement a goal system to help the user adjust how they currently use their time and accomplish certain goals (i.e. spend 30 mins max. on social media)
