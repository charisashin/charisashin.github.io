        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div>

          <p>Our overall goal, as detailed by our instructor, was to design the interface of a startup’s mobile application with only the understanding of the company’s objective and no previous knowledge of the appearance or functionality.</p>
          <p>Quirk is an app that was pitched at the YCombinator's S19 Demo Day. Described as a "thought diary" that helps to stop panic attacks by using the concepts of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Quirk acts as a journal and a platform for self-accountability and improvement.</p>

        <h2>Research and Experiment</h2>
        <p>On a national level, mental health awareness has skyrocketed over the last decade. To understand the issue more deeply
        and the obstacles currently challenging future endeavors, I researched how mental health affects people worldwide.</p>

            <h3>Forming a Solution</h3>
            <p><strong>1. Everyone struggles with mental health.</strong> The user base could range from someone in elementary
              school to a senior citizen, so our product needs to be simple and straightforward.
            </p>
            <p><strong>2. Mental health covers a lot of ground,</strong> so our solution needs to break
            Cognitive Behavioral Therapy into both digestable and comprehensive steps.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Mental health issues are private!</strong> As a result, our solution has an ethical
            duty to keep all data and entries secure.</p>
            <p>Our solution is Quirk: a mobile journaling application for self-accountability and improvement.</p>

        <h3>Iterative design approach</h3>
        <p>To build a product based on real-life user input, we tested and designed the interface in iterative steps.
          Through a rapid prototyping process, we were able to produce mocks that could be easily improved and
          tweaked according to user research and testing.</p>

        <h3>Rapid prototyping</h3>
        <p><strong>Wireframing:</strong> To get input from all four designers working on this project,
        we each created a set of wireframes of the main screens and worked to consolidate the preferred
      features of each into one cohesive sketch.</p>
        <p><strong>First iteration:</strong> Features included a highlighting system for categorization, tagging
        abilities, and large icons for easy accessibility. </p>

            <h2>Design Iteration</h2>
            <p>After walking through an interactive prototype in front of a TA and our classmates, we
            established three main challenges to tackle in our next iteration.</p>
            <p><strong>1. Improving readability.</strong><br> We needed to provide greater contrasts
            between background and text so users could enjoy more efficient and effective interactions.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Enabling sharing.</strong><br>To encourage seeking help, we decided to
              give users the option of sharing entries with therapists or any other chosen contacts.
            </p>
            <p><strong>3. Providing privacy.</strong><br>Because of the private nature of the app's
            content, we added a PIN-enabled lock screen that users could control according to their discretion.</p>

        <h3>Second design iteration</h3>
        <p>Based on the challenges we compiled, we made changes to the interface. The resulting second high-fidelity prototype
        is displayed below, complete with new additional lock screen and sharing pages.  </p>

            <h3>User testing results</h3>
            <p>To assess the usability of our interface and its features, we used the site UserTesting.com through which remote participants tested our product according to a few guiding questions we created beforehand. We hypothesized that our interface was simple enough that most users would complete it fairly quickly and without too much difficulty.
            Our testing results supported our hypothesis, as displayed below.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways & Moving Forward</h2>

            <p>Working on Quirk led me to think about how to best break down a broad, far-reaching topic (dealing with negativity) into digestible steps that are easy to follow.
            Moving forward, I will be taking the concepts of this project and applying them to my research on tackling cognitive distortions through interactive journaling with UCLA's HCI Lab. (For more
            on that project, please stay tuned!)</p>
