    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div>
      <p>AI applications can offer many valuable qualities to mental health treatment, including 24/7 accessibility and responsiveness, privacy protection through anonymity, and potential solutions to barriers such as a lack of providers in rural
        areas and feelings of fear, guilt, or shame that may stop someone with depression from reaching out to others.</p>
      <p>However, current AI-based technologies revolve around creating patterned and consistent Q&A chatbots and do not employ the adaptive and personalized qualities that would help a user actively learn from their own journaling. This UCLA HCI Lab project
        aims to use expressive journaling to aid a user in changing their negative thinking.

      <h3>The Goal</h3>
      <p>
        Working with psychology professors and counselors, our team from <a href="https://hci.ucla.edu">UCLA's HCI Lab</a> aimed to explore how AI could aid in mental health intervention, specifically through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).
        Through developing Journey, an <strong>emotional support platform </strong>in the form of an interactive web journal, we are actively seeking ways to help users learn from thoughts relating to feelings of depression, anxiety, or stress.

    <h3>Existing Products</h3>
    <p>There are two primary types of mental health technologies on the market right now: self-help reflection platforms without an interactive AI (check my case study on one of them <a href="../work/quirk.html">here!</a>), and AI-based chatbots that
      help a user step through their thoughts using patterned answers.</p>

      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Varying levels of personal connection.</strong><br>Applications can range from intimate communication
          through AI-led text message conversations to more impersonal, self-guided documentation.</li>
        <li><strong>The necessity of raising emotional awareness.</strong><br>All of the programs focus on helping
          the user to raise their own awareness of their emotional state and reactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited interaction and personalization.</strong><br>Most applications
          have a fixed level of AI intervention, which doesn't allow for users to take control of the expression process.</li>

    <h3>Background Research</h3>
    <p><strong>ü§î Cognitive distortions cause individuals to perceive reality inaccurately.</strong>
      These distortions kind of automatic thinking and can contribute to overall pessimism and depression. Challenging
      and changing these skewed thoughts are a key element to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).</p>
    <p><strong>‚úèÔ∏è Words can act as references for cognitive distortions.</strong>
      Certain words with <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07502.pdf" target="_blank">negative connotations</a> can be linked to different cognitive distortion patterns. Finding and correcting those
      words could have a signficant impact on a user's thought process.</p>

    <h2>Prototyping Process</h2>
    <h3>Brainstorming & Ideation</h3>
    <p>The initial stages of brainstorming required a balance of focal points: my team had to consider
      both the NLP processes behind the software and the visual interface with which the user would interact.
      Designing the interface UI depended heavily on what AI features would be implemented, which meant I was constant collaborating
      with software engineers on sketching out the wireframes.</p>

    <h3>First-Iteration Prototypes</h3>
    <p>In the end, we compiled descriptions of the main features and how they would appear within the UI.
      The design decisions we established were mostly related to the flow of the CBT procedure in catching, checking, and
      challenging cognitive distortions.</p>

  <section id="Professional_Feedback" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
    <h2>Professional Feedback</h2>
    <p>To ensure that this web application is clincally viable and to evaluate the quality of our interactive system, our team met regularly with psychology professionals,
      including professors and practicing counselors from UCLA.
      Regular feedback from professionals, as listed below, provided insights for each iteration of both the back-end system and front-end interface design. I regularly drew from notes from the interviews to inform my UX decisions.</p>
    <div class="center">
      <h2></h2>
      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Technology as an emerging means for therapy.</strong><br>Research indicates that people will be more
          honest with a computer than with a clinician or therapist they don't know.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple language is more accessible. </strong><br>It's important to make the language
          of the application as simple as possible, since "over-intellectualization" can actually have negative effects on the user's experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Evaluating interventions.</strong><br>In principle, every assessment is an intervention and every
          intervention is an assessment. Thus, every time a user doesn't respond, it's informative of something deeper.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="col-2">
      <div>
        <p><strong>üëçüèª Things to Do</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep it flexible: in a regular therapy setting, it wouldn't be unusual for a client to switch subjects suddenly; the interface
            has to be prepared for those topic changes.</li>
          <li>Give the user written feedback: establish reliability of the AI and help the user understand their own reactivity and tendencies
            by providing regular feedback.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>üëéüèª Things to Avoid</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Challenging surface-level thoughts: users usually know when they're making a false statement
            (i.e. "I'm an idiot"), so it's important to focus on more subtle distortions.</li>
          <li>Designing an exclusive interface: though the UI design could be neutral, the UX
            elements surrounding accessibility must not follow a one-size-fits-all structure.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>AI Intervention</h2>
    <h3>Mapping the App Features</h3>
    <p>To understand how the AI would interact with the user through the journaling platform, our group devised a chart to display the different levels of AI intervention and what features would correlate with each tier.

    <h2>Motion Demo</h2>
      <p>After garnering information and feedback from our interviews with professors and psychology professionals, my co-designer, Brandon Ngo, established the UI design system and language
        for the second design iteration, while I covered motion design details for seamless interactions.</p>

        <h3>Feature 1: Auto-Suggest</h3>
        <p>With the goal of encouraging users to change their mindsets, we provided alternative words and phrases to what they wrote down. Similar to the smart compose function of Gmail,
          the application generates more positive ways to finish sentences.

        We chose to use a moving three-dot symbol to represent the computer "typing" a response to the entry, much like in a text conversation with a human companion.</p>

      <p>In order to help the user build a collaborative relationship with the AI, empathetic phrasing and a gentle UI design

  <section id="Accessibility_Measures" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
    <h2>Enhancing accessibility</h2>
    <p>Because mental health affects anyone regardless of background or ability, accessibility measures are a critical consideration. For Journey, I led the initiative in implementing inclusive design choices for the interface, which comprised of
    creating color manipulations according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/low-vision-needs/">W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> and selective portions of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/">Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.</a> </p>
    <br><br><br><br><br>
    <div class="center">
    <h3>Dark mode</h3>
    <p>To address the problems of eye strain and to improve visibility for users with low vision and those sensitive to bright light, I spearheaded the development of a dark mode option initiated by a toggle switch.
       By designing inclusively for those with vision needs, I could also cater to a wider user base with temporary impairments (like being in a dark room) or those who may just prefer a darker interface. </p>

      <p class="caption">Example of a dark mode page</p>
    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    <h3>Accessible color contrasts</h3>
    <p>To accomodate colorblind or color-sensitive users, I followed WGAC 2.0 standards and developed a color palette that accounted for both deuteranopia and protanopia colorblindness conditions. Such a palette could be applied through the Themes tab.</p>

    <div class="center">
      <h2>Takeaways & Next Steps</h2>
      <p>Working on Journey truly challenged me as a designer and researcher, especially in the realm of accessibility. To fully empathize with a range of users,
        I had to carefully adhere to inclusive design standards and focus on solving for a certain user group first. I was inspired to brainstorm further about how I might
        approach building solutions for mental health problems in a way that would allow for anyone to participate in the experience with a sense of belonging.</p>
      <p><strong>Moving Forward</strong><br>
        <p>Journey is still a developmental work in progress. Next steps involve moving into initiating a pilot program with real-time and constant users.
        I will be working to actively carry out usability tests on a larger demographic to improve the last iteration.</p>
