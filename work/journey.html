    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div>
      <p>AI applications can offer many valuable qualities to mental health treatment, including 24/7 accessibility and responsiveness, privacy protection through anonymity, and potential solutions to barriers such as a lack of providers in rural
        areas and feelings of fear, guilt, or shame that may stop someone with depression from reaching out to others.</p>
      <p>However, current AI-based technologies revolve around creating patterned and consistent Q&A chatbots and do not employ the adaptive and personalized qualities that would help a user actively learn from their own journaling. This UCLA HCI Lab project
        aims to use expressive journaling to aid a user in changing their negative thinking.

      <h3>The Goal</h3>
      <p>
        Working with psychology professors and counselors, our team from <a href="https://hci.ucla.edu">UCLA's HCI Lab</a> aimed to explore how AI could aid in mental health intervention, specifically through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).
        Through developing Journey, an <strong>emotional support platform </strong>in the form of an interactive web journal, we are actively seeking ways to help users learn from thoughts relating to feelings of depression, anxiety, or stress.

    <h3>Existing Products</h3>
    <p>There are two primary types of mental health technologies on the market right now: self-help reflection platforms without an interactive AI (check my case study on one of them <a href="../work/quirk.html">here!</a>), and AI-based chatbots that
      help a user step through their thoughts using patterned answers.</p>

      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Varying levels of personal connection.</strong><br>Applications can range from intimate communication
          through AI-led text message conversations to more impersonal, self-guided documentation.</li>
        <li><strong>The necessity of raising emotional awareness.</strong><br>All of the programs focus on helping
          the user to raise their own awareness of their emotional state and reactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited interaction and personalization.</strong><br>Most applications
          have a fixed level of AI intervention, which doesn't allow for users to take control of the expression process.</li>

    <h3>Background Research</h3>
    <p><strong>ü§î Cognitive distortions cause individuals to perceive reality inaccurately.</strong>
      These distortions kind of automatic thinking and can contribute to overall pessimism and depression. Challenging
      and changing these skewed thoughts are a key element to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).</p>
    <p><strong>‚úèÔ∏è Words can act as references for cognitive distortions.</strong>
      Certain words with <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07502.pdf" target="_blank">negative connotations</a> can be linked to different cognitive distortion patterns. Finding and correcting those
      words could have a signficant impact on a user's thought process.</p>

    <h2>Prototyping Process</h2>
    <h3>Brainstorming & Ideation</h3>
    <p>The initial stages of brainstorming were interesting to me because our team had to consider
      both the NLP processes behind the software and the visual interface with which the user would interact.
      Designing the interface UI depended heavily on what AI features would be implemented, which meant constant collaboration
      with the engineers on sketching out the wireframes.</p>

    <h3>First-Iteration Prototypes</h3>
    <p>In the end, we compiled descriptions of the main features and how they would appear within the UI.
      The design decisions we established were mostly related to the flow of the CBT procedure in catching, checking, and
      challenging cognitive distortions.</p>

  <section id="Professional_Feedback" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
    <h2>Professional Feedback</h2>
    <p>To ensure that this web application is clincally viable and to evaluate the quality of our interactive system, our team met regularly with psychology professionals,
      including professors and practicing counselors.
      Regular feedback from professionals, as listed below, provided insights for each iteration of both the back-end system and front-end interface design.</p>
    <div class="center">
      <h2></h2>
      <h3>Insights</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Technology as an emerging means for therapy.</strong><br>Research indicates that people will be more
          honest with a computer than with a clinician or therapist they don't know.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple language is more accessible. </strong><br>It's important to make the language
          of the application as simple as possible, since "over-intellectualization" can actually have negative effects on the user's experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Evaluating interventions.</strong><br>In principle, every assessment is an intervention and every
          intervention is an assessment. Thus, every time a user doesn't respond, it's informative.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="col-2">
      <div>
        <p><strong>üëçüèª Things to Do</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep it flexible: in a regular therapy setting, it wouldn't be unusual for a client to switch subjects suddenly; the interface
            has to be prepared for those topic changes.</li>
          <li>Give the user written feedback: establish reliability of the AI and help the user understand their own reactivity and tendencies
            by providing regular feedback.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>üëéüèª Things to Avoid</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Challenging surface-level thoughts: users usually know when they're making a false statement
            (i.e. "I'm an idiot"), so it's important to focus on more subtle distortions.</li>
          <li>Designing an overly specific interface: although there isn't going to be an interface design that is
            optimal for every user, it's good to keep it as neutral as possible.</li>

    <h2>AI Intervention</h2>
    <h3>Mapping the App Features</h3>
    <p>To understand how the AI would interact with the user through the journaling platform, our group devised a chart to display the different levels of AI intervention and what features would correlate with each tier.

    <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
      <p>After garnering information and feedback from our interviews with professors and psychology professionals, another designer and I worked on high-fidelity prototypes
        and motion designs of the second design iteration. We focused specifically on how elements of the UI could lend to the user's success in expressing their thoughts,
      including typography, colors, iconography, margins and text placement, motion graphics, and the overall visual framework of the interface.</p>

          the application generates more positive ways to finish sentences.

        <p>To encourage further introspection, we provided users with probing questions in order to discover the deeper reason behind the their negative emotions.
        We chose to use a moving three-dot symbol to represent the computer "typing" a response to the entry, much like in a text conversation with a human companion.</p>

      <h3>Feature 4: Connection & Friendship</h3>
      <p>In order to help the user build a collaborative relationship with the AI, empathetic phrasing and a gentle UI design
        were critical. Softer elements make the user feel more at ease and more comfortable with sharing deeply.

      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <p>Journey is still a developmental work in progress. Next steps involve moving into wizard-of-oz and user testing.
      This step is especially crucial since the interface revolves so heavily around users and their experiences. As a designer,
    I will be working to carry out tests on remote and local users and to reconcile user testing results with the next design interation. </p>
      <p><strong>Constant collaboration!</strong><br>
        <p>I will also be continuing to work closely with the software engineers on our team to tie the back-end NLP processes
          with the front-end interface by carefully crafting the UI to accomodate both design and engineering purposes. Check back soon
        to find out more about our progress on this project!</p>
