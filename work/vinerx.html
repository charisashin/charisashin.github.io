        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Drug rebates, or price concessions that are enacted after a transaction is processed, are used to lower prices for certain drugs. From the governmental side, the Medical Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) helps to offset Federal and state costs of most outpatient prescription drugs distributed to Medicaid patients. </p><p>However, the procedure for physicians and pharmacists (through their respective physician offices and pharmacies) to obtain these rebates involves complex online software and paperwork and can take excruciatingly long to process.</p>

            <h3>The Goal</h3>
            <p>I aimed for Vinerx's design to <strong>simplify and streamline</strong> the pharmaceutical rebate process through providing a submission portal for physicians and pharmacists.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>Existing Products</h3>
        <p>Currently, the main platform for pharmaceutical rebate processing is RebateWeb, an online site that "quickly and efficiently transports Drug Rebate Program invoice files to and from manufacturers."
        However, its design is clunky and hard to navigate, slowing down the process and frustrating users.</p>

            <h3>Insights</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Clear and organized infrastructure is ideal.</strong><br>The rebate process can be
                long and intimidating, so a straightforward structure is paramount.</li>
                <li><strong>The necessity of tracking progress.</strong><br>Because the process requires multiple
                steps, it's important to include some means of being able to track where you are in it.</li>
                <li><strong>Facilitating quick turnarounds between payor and payee.</strong><br>To enable quick transactions
                and requests, paperwork and file uploading must be as seamless as possible.</li>

        <h2>Prototyping</h2>
        <h3>Mapping the User Flow</h3>
        <p>A user flow map was created to understand the process that users would follow from client account set up all the way to the rebate submission and obtainment. The left side of the map represents the components required for a client to create a new account, while the right side reflects the steps of drug selection, form completion, and claim submission.

                <h3>Building upon a skeleton</h3>
                <p>With the user flow map as a guiding skeleton, I created low-fidelity wireframes to create a basic framework of what each page would look like. I wanted to enable easy navigation and strong visual cues, so I created a side menu that allows the user to track their progress as they complete different steps of the process.</p>

    <section id="Takeaways" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
        <div class="center">
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>Although Vinerx is still a developmental work in progress, the first iterations of the design have been completed.
            I'm currently waiting to receive feedback to move into the second iteration stage.  </p>
            <p><strong>Infrastructure is everything!</strong><br>
                Often, a complex problem can be addressed best by stripping it to its skeleton and working from there.
                I found that the pharmaceutical rebate process suffered from confusing forms and portals, so my
                central objective lay in simplifying the infrastructure. It was quite fun to take a macro-level
              problem and condense it into something that was clear, straightforward, and efficient.</p>
