    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div>
      <p>For Summer 2021, I worked as a UX Design Intern with the Yammer team at Microsoft. I was tasked with the responsibility of designing end-to-end the onboarding experience of two new features—Storyline and Stories—across Yammer, Outlook, Teams, and Viva.</p>
      <p> I also designed the admin controls for this feature,
        as well as the mobile experience for both iOS and Android. I collaborated cross-functionally with teams across the M365 suite, including PMs, designers, engineers, researchers, copywriters, and managers.
      </p>
      <p class="bold">Due to my NDA, this case study spans Yammer and Outlook Web only.</p>

    <h2>User Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Thanks to the consumer space, the interaction patterns of publishing a Story or a post to your personal profile are generally familiar to most users. However, when extended to the enterprise realm, these patterns can get lost in translation and also require parameters to follow corporate etiquette.
        <span class="bold">How can we position and design Storyline and Stories for effective education and moderation in order to build community?</span>

  <section id="Solution" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>An onboarding experience that focuses on educational, in-product interactions and an admin controls flow to regulate feature use. Two
      separate flows for Storyline and Stories that can translate across M365 suite products.</p>

    <h2>Gaining context</h2>
    <p>In order to understand the context of these upcoming features, I collaborated with a couple of researchers on the Yammer team to draw
      from past studies on enterprise software patterns and target personas. Using these findings, I worked with PMs to refine problem statements
      and create hypotheses as groundwork for the UX.

    <h2>Validating through user research</h2>
    <p>I had the opportunity to engage in real user research alongside my mentor and two PMs during a day-long flash feedback session. Through a
      series of interviews, we gauged reactions from and formed use cases with potential users of Storyline and Stories.

    <h3 style="color:#d9d9d9;">02: Iterate</h3>
    <h2>Designing empathetic UX</h2>
    <p>On a weekly basis, I brought my designs to crit to receive feedback from the team's designers, researchers, and copywriters. Through this
      input, I learned to meet users where they are, instead of disorienting them through unfamiliar patterns. Later iterations reflect
      education that lets the user take control and progress at their own pace.

  <section data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
    <h2>Scale for millions of users</h2>
    <p>This internship was my first experience designing for potentially millions of users. Adjusting to such a staggering number meant
      learning to make my designs scalable and flexible, even with their edge cases. I also learned to align my design objectives with external
      Admin Tools teams, which helped me solidify the design system and security/privacy measures.

    <h2>Considering engineering costing</h2>
    <p>Because Storyline and Stories are slated for Q4 2021, I worked with copywriters to localize and finalize strings and with PMs and engineers to push my projects to the quarter's backlog.
      From the start, I had established engineering paramters with my lead PM to scope out the timeline and requirements for my designs, which certainly helped
      down the line when reviewing details with my feature crew.

    <div class="center">
      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <p>I'm very thankful for my team and the opportunity to work on such impactful and user-facing projects. Among many other things, I learned to:</p><br><br>
      <h3>Understand the Microsoft ecosystem</h3>
      <p>From Fluent UI to Yammer's own design system, I learned to navigate the complexities of Microsoft's ecosystem by
      referencing past projects, drawing from current ones, communicating non-stop with team members, and educating myself on the business' vision and mission.</p><br><br>
      <h3>Tell a story from start to finish</h3>
      <p>Because I was constantly working between teams, communicating with PMs, engineers, and designers alike, I
         had to ensure there was enough context for my designs when I presented them to a new audience. I borrowed a lot of elements from my
         own affinity for reading to frame my work, including detailing characters and crafting the environment.</p><br><br>
      <h3>Proactively establish parameters</h3>
      <p>At the start of my internship, my projects were fairly loosely defined, which I quickly learned meant that I had to take iniative in confirming
      the timeline, scope, and bounds of my design work from the start. I took proactive steps towards filtering feedback, iterating quickly, and staying flexible
      through structural changes. </p>
