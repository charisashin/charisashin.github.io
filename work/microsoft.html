    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div>
      <p>For Summer 2021, I worked as a UX Design Intern with the Yammer team at Microsoft. Normally, I would be based out of the San Francisco office, but because of COVID-19, I conducted the internship remotely from L.A.</p>
      <p>I was tasked with the responsibility of designing the onboarding experience of a new feature across Yammer, Outlook, Teams, and Viva. I also designed the admin controls for this feature,
        as well as the mobile experience. I collaborated cross-functionally with teams across the M365 suite, including PMs, designers, engineers, copywriters, and managers.

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p><span class="bold">This project is currently under NDA, so unfortunately I can't share too much information at the moment. If you'd like to find
      out more, <a href="mailto:charisa_shin@brown.edu">shoot me an email</a>!</span>
      <p>However, I've learned a ton at a high level as well about design, communication, and collaboration. Working cross-functionally taught me to
        bridge information gaps, navigate through ambiguity, and provide context for deeper understanding.
        Keep reading to hear about some of my main discoveries and takeaways from this summer so far.

  <section id="Takeaways" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <p>Although my internship is ongoing, I've already learned significantly about how to deliver top-quality user experience designs and partner effectively with other teams. I'm immensely grateful for this opportunity
      and attribute my growth so far to a wonderful team and community.</p><br><br>
      <h3>Tell a story from start to finish</h3>
      <p>Because I was constantly working between teams, communicating with PMs, engineers, and designers alike, I had to ensure there was enough context for my designs when I presented them to a new audience.
      As I result, I framed my presentations as a story from the perspective of a potential user in order to remain user-centric and effective in my communication.</p><br><br>
      <h3>Solve ambiguity by asking questions</h3>
      <p>Because I was given full autonomy to conduct research, iterate, and prototype on my own, I had to navigate through ambiguity and overlapping timelines for different projects. I learned
      to ask questions and seek out answers by referencing past research and talking (both formally and informally) with people across teams.</p><br><br>
      <h3>Proactively establish parameters</h3>
      <p>This was my first time working with a large company, so I had to adjust to the framework of quarterly reviews and engineering costing. I soon realized the importance
      of aligning my design work with the greater needs and goals of the company. Thus, I learned to establish engineering and versioning parameters from the start of my projects, in order
      to scope out the timeline and requirements for my designs.</p>
