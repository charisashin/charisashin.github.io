      <h3 id='s1' class='section'>BACKGROUND</h3>
      <h2>The struggle of political participation</h2>
      <p>I've always found it personally difficult to learn about political issues from an objective, comprehensive point of view. Almost every reference source has its own agenda, its own supporters, and its own objective.
        Many Americans, especially young citizens, possess political views influenced and shaped by social media, but often lack the fundamental definitions to understand the very issues they share, retweet, and post about. </p>
      <p>
        This project, created with a few other students from Brown, aims to educate Americans about popular politics issues without taking a partisan position. By providing definitions and background information
        on certain policies, we hoped to break down topics into simple, easy-to-understand explanations.
      </p>



      <div class="space15px"></div><br>
      <h3 id='s2' class='section'>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
      <h2>How can we educate readers about political issues with both clarity and objectivity?</h2>
      <p>According to a study by Harvard University's Institute of Politics, "less than half of young Americans vote, even in presidential elections, and just 10 percent of Americans between 18 and 24 met a standard of “informed engagement” in the
        2012 presidential election cycle."
      </p>
      <p>
        On top of a lack of knowledge, a lack of objectivity can repel readers, especially young readers, from being politically active or up to date with current events.
        Without a strong underlying understanding of issues and ideologies, the news can seem like a daunting and unappealing landscape. Through this project, we aimed to
        tackle some of the challenges keeping American citizens from consistent political participation and seeking further education.
      </p>

      <h3 id='s3' class='section'>TACKLING THE QUESTIONS</h3>
      <h2>Mapping out the positive and negative experiences</h2>
      <p>To flesh out the challenges that many American citizens face in becoming politically aware, we created a journey map that serves as a model of pros and cons of current and common experiences. With both positive and negative traits of
        political participation,
        news topics, objectivity in the news, and the surface design of news sources, we ventured to come up with a summary of the overarching problems we would attempt to address with our interface.

        <h3 id='s4' class='section'>PROTOTYPING A SOLUTION</h3>
        <h2>Creating answers to the challenges</h2>
        <p>With both the positive and negative experiences in mind, I created a set of high-fidelity prototypes to address both the problems of modern-day news sources and incorporate what they do currently do well. A few highlighted points of this
          prototype include:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-list">
          <li>Straying away from the classic newspaper/blog appearance in favor of a informatics-based, illustration-heavy interface</li>
          <li>Breaking down macro-level issues into smaller topics and policies</li>
          <li>Relying on graphics instead of photos that may perpetuate inherent bias</li>
          <li>Information that strives to educate at face value rather than inculcate an ideology</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <div class="project-img-div-long">
          <img class="project-img-long" src="../assets/Politics/flowchart.png" alt="Flowchart of screens">
                    </div>
          <br><br>
          <h2>Style Guide</h2>
          <div class="project-img-div-med">
            <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/Politics/politics_guide.png" alt="Style guide">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>In brainstorming what design decisions to make for the interface, I chose a simple palette based on primary colors to reflect an American identity.
              I wanted to make the site as neutral as possible in terms of colors and graphics, to encourage and foster an environment of education and knowledge-building rather than persuasion or propaganda.

              <h3 id='s5' class='section'>UPCOMING TASKS</h3>
              <h2>What needs to be done moving forward</h2>
              <p>Politics Unscrambled is still very much a work in progress. Next semester, I will be working with a software engineer in piecing together an <b>interactive, responsive site</b> that reflects the prototype I created. Together
                with several content writers, I plan to also <b>add extensively to the list of issues </b> and their respective pages. Lastly, I envision designing content to <b>inform
          readers on how they can participate and serve tangibly in political processes </b>and their respective communities, taking the information our site provides to help and educate others. </p>
