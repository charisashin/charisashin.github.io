      <h2>Storytelling about the AAPIA Experience</h2>
      <p>VISIONS is a publication that celebrates the diversity of Brown and RISD's Asian/Asian American community. We are committed to being an open literary and artistic forum for Asians and Asian Americans, as well as other members of the
        university community, to freely express and address issues relating to both the Asian and Asian American experience. VISIONS further serves as a forum for issues that cannot find a voice in other campus publications. As a collaborative
        initiative, VISIONS attempts to strengthen and actively engage Brown and RISD's vibrant community of students, faculty, staff, and alumni, as well as the larger Providence community.</p>

          <h3 id='s2' class='section'>DESIGNING THE WEB IDENTITY</h3>
          <h2>Translating paper to pixels</h2>

          <p>
            As the Web Designer and Developer, I designed, prototyped, and developed the website for VISIONS, crafting a distinct visual identity through the layout and thematic elements to represent the magazine's mission of giving voice to Asian
            and Asian-American artists and writers. I worked alongside a Web Content Editor to regularly populate the site with continued content from the print publication, upcoming events, and special online features, like interviews and artist
            spotlights. The website acts as a supplementary platform that extends the print issues in certain areas.
          </p>

          <div class="space15px"></div>
          <h2>Style Guide</h2>
          <div class="project-img-div-med">
            <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/VISIONS/visions_guide.png" alt="VISIONS style guide">
            </div><br>
            <p>In developing the style guide for the website, I chose a palette that reflected the current and previous print issues of the magazine. VISIONS tends to favor art pieces that dip into issues dealing with identity, background and
              heritage, and reconciling cultural roots - topics that depict the artist as a little hesitant and certainly still growing. I tried to echo those themes in the colors I chose, balancing between bolder, more decisive shades and lighter,
              shyer pastels.</b>.

            <h2> Executing the Design</h2>
            <p>After deciding on the stylistic elements, I prototyped each page of the website to pitch with the Editors-in-Chief and receive feedback. Below, the elongated home page reveals the highlighted sections of the mission statement,
              continued stories from the print publications, events, and a subscriber feed to the mailing list.

              <h2>To implement moving forward</h2>
              <p>The website, <a href="http://visions-mag.com">visions-mag.com</a> was launched at our 2019 Release Party on December 6th. Next semester, I plan to implement the following ideas and improvements: </p>

                <h3 id='s5' class='section'>REFLECTIONS</h3>
                <h2>As an Asian-American creative...</h2>
                <p>
                  I joined VISIONS in my sophomore year of my undergraduate studies and have since benefitted immensely from my work with the magazine. Not only was I able to fulfill a long-lasting passion of mine in sharing untold stories about the
                  Asian and Asian-American experience, I was given creative liberties in shaping the website to reflect how I envisioned visual design could best convey the mission of the magazine. In designing and developing the website within a
                  community built around a common creative vision, I was able to both grow my skills in visual thinking and solidify my identity as an Asian-American creative.
