      <h3 id='s1' class='section'>BACKGROUND</h3>

      <h2>How can we effectively leverage cognitive behavioral therapy to alleviate mental health issues? </h2>
      <p>On a national level, mental health awareness has skyrocketed over the last five years. With public figures espousing the importance of seeking both informal and professional help and reducing the social stigma surrounding tackling mental
        health, the issue has become increasingly more widespread and has risen as a pressing concern to address. As a result, endless opportunities have emerged in advancing the quality of care, innovation, and the value of effective, accessible
        mental health care.

        ​</p>

      <p>One particular approach to improving mental health lies in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This kind of therapy revolves around vocalizing problems, identifying negative thinking and behavior, and reframing challenging situations to
        respond to them better in the future. Uncomplicated and introspective, CBT poses as an accessible means to treat poor mental health. Furthermore, it allows for those using it to reap the benefits of making an impact on their own lives.

        <h3 id='s2' class='section'>OUR CHALLENGE</h3>
        <h2>Starting design for a startup</h2>
        <p>Our overall goal, as detailed by our instructor, was to design the interface of a startup’s mobile application with only the understanding of the company’s objective and no previous knowledge of the appearance or functionality.

        </p>
        <p>

          Quirk is an app that was pitched at the YCombinator's S19 Demo Day. Described as a "thought diary" that helps to stop panic attacks by using the concepts of CBT, Quirk acts as a journal and a platform for self-accountability and
          improvement. According to the startup's website, Quirk implements the popular and practical CBT exercise of catching, checking, and changing the problem at hand. This kind of thinking can help combat any kind or degree of stress, sadness,
          or fear, so it can apply even to a person not dealing with a clinical mental disorder.</p>
        <p>
          We wanted to design Quirk to help users tackling both clinically diagnosed mental disorders and those merely looking to lower their everyday stress levels. By interacting with an intuitive, calming interface, we hoped that users would look
          forward to documenting and processing their thoughts with this app.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Our challenges:

        </p>
        <ul class="text-list">
          <li><b>Breaking down Cognitive Behavioral Therapy into digestable steps</b></li>
          <li><b>Retaining users for regular, meaningful interactions </b></li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Emmett</h2>

              </div><br>
          <p>Emmett is a Computer Engineering student at his local university. Due to his heavy workload and recent family troubles, Emmett is constantly under high stress.
            Recently diagnosed with <b>anxiety</b> and <b>panic disorder</b>, Emmett takes a few different medications every day and visits a personal on-campus therapist regularly.
            These days, he's been thinking about journaling, but finds a pen and paper too inconvenient to carry around...

              Connie works as a Product Manager for a popular online shopping service. In her free time, she likes to hike and go deep-sea diving to take a break from work.
              She often wishes she had something to help her <b>process</b> and <b>think through</b> some of the issues that have been emerging at work lately.
              Fun activities are a nice distraction, but is there something that will help her deal <b>long-term</b>?

            <h3 id='s4' class='section'>DEFINING THE USER EXPERIENCE</h3>
            <h2>Planning the architecture and flow of the interface</h2>

            <p>After brainstorming the necessary pages for our interface, we created a user flow to connect each page in a linear, streamlined way.
            </p>
            <div class="project-img-div-med">
              <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/Quirk/user_flow.png" alt="Users don't know what to look for">
            </div>
              <br>



              <h2>Wireframing & Low-Fidelity Prototyping</h2>
              <p>Our team discussed the advantages, disadvantages, and an array of options for our design before jumping into the wireframing process. We had previously decided upon four main pages to cover in our prototype: <b>Welcome</b>, <b>New Entry</b>,
                <b>History</b>, and <b>Examining Thoughts</b>. <br><br>Each of us created wireframes according to our personal interpretation of what the app should look like before comparing the four different sets altogether. It was fascinating to see how each of our proposed designs all revolved around the same underlying concepts, but still varied in noticeable ways. </p>

                <div class="project-img-div-long">
                  <img class="project-img-long" src="../assets/Quirk/wireframes.png" alt="Users don't care that much">
            </div>
                  <br>

                  <p>After each of us created wireframes based on our own interpretations of what the app should look like, we discussed what elements we liked from each separate prototype, arranging an idea of what the final product should include.
                    Using a skeleton outline, we started moving toward a hi-fi prototype.</p>


                  <div class="space15px"></div>
                  <h3 id='s5' class='section'>HIGH-FIDELITY PROTOTYPING</h3>
                  <h2>Adding life and usability to the interface</h2>
                  <p>Based on the low-fidelity prototypes, I created a style guide and gradient-based backgrounds for the app. With these elements, I crafted a high-fidelity prototype, centering the colors and graphics around a desert theme. Because
                    cognitive behavioral therapy requires much self-reflection and introspection, I wanted the app's visual brand to encourage calm and rational thinking. The desert motif reflects a landscape that experiences both a blistering, dry
                    day, as well a cool, healing night -- two parallels that can also apply to anyone's life. </p>

                  <br>

                        <h2>Challenging our prototype and improving it</h2>
                        <p>After composing our first set of high-fidelity prototypes, we walked through an interactive prototype in front of twenty other students and a TA during an in-class critique. Garnering the comments and recommendations we
                          received, we then established three main challenges to tackle in our next design iteration. </p>

                        <h3 style="color:black">Challenge 1: Improving Readability</h3>
                        <p>Altering the color scheme for greater contrasts between background and text for increased readability</p>

                        <h3 style="color:black">Challenge 2: Enabling Sharing</h3>
                        <p>Including the option to enable sharing abilities so the user can send chosen entries to their designated recipients</p>

                        <h3 style="color:black">Challenge 3: Providing Privacy</h3>
                        <p>Providing options to regulate the app's privacy through a lock screen and a changeable PIN</p>
<br>
                        <h2>Resulting Prototypes</h2>
                        <p>
                          In addressing the challenges brought up by the critique, our team tweaked our prototypes to improve usability, readability, and memorability. In the end, to tackle Challenge 1, we changed the color scheme to better
                          reinforce the day and night motif and improve readability through greater color contrasts. In facing Challenge 2, we gave the user the option of turning on sharing abilities, which would complete the new entry cycle.
                          Finally, for Challenge 3, we implemented a lock screen with the option of changing the PIN through the settings page.

                          <h2>User Testing</h2>
                          <p>
                            To assess the usability of our interface and its features, we used the site UserTesting.com through which remote participants tested our product according to a few guiding questions we created beforehand. We hypothesized
                            that our interface was simple enough that most users would complete it fairly quickly and without too much difficulty. Below are the quantitative metrics we used to measure their responses and our qualitative analyses of
                            those metrics.
                          </p>
                          <h3 style="color:black">Task 1: Create a New Entry</h3>
                          <p>
                            Completion rate: 100% <br>
                            Average Time on Task: 1 min 12 secs <br>
                            Error Count: 1
                            <h4>(User Wendy confused the purpose of the New Entry page)</h4>
                          </p>
                          <div class="project-img-div-med">
                            <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/Quirk/new_entry.png" alt="Users don't care that much" style="width:20%">
                      </div>
                            <h3 style="color:black">Task 2: View a Previous Entry</h3>
                            <p>
                              Completion rate: 100% <br>
                              Average Time on Task: 38 secs <br>
                              Error Count: 0
                            </p>
                            <div class="project-img-div-med">

                        </div>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>
                          In the end, we accepted our hypothesis due to the 100% completion rate by each user for both tasks and the low average time on both tasks. For the first task (as compared to the second), the time spent completing the task was much greater since users usually spent time describing their thought processes before jumping into the actual action.

​<br><br>

We assessed user satisfaction as high since no user expressed trouble navigating the interface due to its simplicity. Wendy called the app "simple and concise", while user David praised the interface as "intentional, clear, and streamlined." Overall, the users rated the interface an average score of 8/10 and said they would recommend the app to others.

                        <h3 id='s7' class='section'>REFLECTIONS</h3>
                        <h2>Looking back and moving forward</h2>
                        <p>
                          Working on Quirk led me to think about how to best break down a broad, far-reaching topic (dealing with negativity) into digestible steps that are easy to follow. The most difficult part of this project was the wireframing process, in determining how Cognitive Behavioral Therapy could be deconstructed into a few screens that would motivate the user to return back to the app repeatedly to input new thoughts and learn from them for positive future change. I learned a great deal through this design process, both about collaborating with a team where each person held differing ideas, and about optimizing an app for those struggling with bettering their mental health.
<br><br>
                          Despite the efforts to destigmatize seeking out mental health resources, there is still pushback at the systemic and social levels against admitting that help is necessary for everyone. I hope that applications like Quirk might be able to make mental health care more accessible, noticeable, and accepted in the near future.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Also, a quick afternote!</h3>
                        <p>
                          Our team emailed the founder of Quirk, Evan Conrad, a copy of our interactive prototype in hopes of getting feedback. He emailed back with several constructive comments, including
                          praises for our design, despite its differences with his own framework.
