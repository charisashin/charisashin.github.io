      <h3 id='s1' class='section'>BACKGROUND</h3>
      <h2>The struggle of pharmaceutical rebates</h2>
      <p>The rising cost of pharmaceuticals poses a constant threat to the financial stability of the U.S. healthcare system and the accessibility of prescription drugs for consumers. With many players in the pharmaceutical industry, there is a constant push-and-pull between pharmaceutical manufacturers, health insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers, consumers, and government/legislative initiative. </p>
      <p>Drug rebates, or price concessions that are enacted after a transaction is processed, are used to lower prices for certain drugs. From the governmental side, the Medical Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) helps to offset Federal and state costs of most outpatient prescription drugs distributed to Medicaid patients. However, the procedure for physicians and pharmacists (through their respective physician offices and pharmacies) to obtain these rebates involves complex online software and paperwork and can take excruciatingly long to process.
      </p>


      <div class="space15px"></div>
      <h3 id='s2' class='section'>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
      <h2>Making the drug rebate process intuitive</h2>
      <p>Vinerx aims to simplify and streamline the pharmaceutical rebate process through providing a submission portal for physicians and pharmacists. The platform would be in place of RebateWeb, the existing rebate processing platform that requires a lengthy manual to navigate its workings. I wanted to design Vinerx’s interface to be uncomplicated and efficient, to allow for rapid and effective use. I hoped that users would return to Vinerx because of its memorability and intuitive structure, and not only out of necessity to complete the rebate process.
      </p>
      <p>Our challenges:

      </p>
      <ul class="text-list">
        <li><b>Simplifying the drug rebate process without losing critical information</b></li>
        <li><b>Enabling secure and private transactions  </b></li>
        <li><b>Facilitate quick turnarounds between payors and payees</b></li>
      </ul>

            <h3 id='s3' class='section'>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
            <h2>Learning from other products</h2>
            <p>Currently, the main platform for pharmaceutical rebate processing is <b>RebateWeb</b>, an online site that "quickly and efficiently transports Drug Rebate Program invoice files to and from manufacturers."
              However, in analyzing the site through its included manual that steps through hundreds of pages explaining the drug selection and online paperwork process, it was clear that navigation was cumbersome
              and difficult through the service. Specifically, I saw problems with <b>nested submission portals</b>, <b>extraneous and distracting features</b>, and a process that was <b>unnecessarily complicated</b>.
            </p><br>

      <h3 id='s3' class='section'>MAPPING THE USER FLOW</h3>
      <h2>From client account setup to rebate claim submission</h2>
      <p>A user flow map was created to understand the process that users would follow from client account set up all the way to the rebate submission and obtainment. The left side of the map represents the components required for a client to create a new account, while the right side reflects the steps of drug selection, form completion, and claim submission.

        <h3 id='s4' class='section'>WIREFRAMING A SOLUTION</h3>
        <h2>Building upon a skeleton</h2>
        <p>With the user flow map as a guiding skeleton, I created low-fidelity wireframes to create a basic framework of what each page would look like. I wanted to enable easy navigation and strong visual cues, which led to the creation of a side menu that allows the user to track their progress as they complete different steps of the process. Because forms are often complicated and discourage fast, intuitive interactions, I designed the spaces for information input as simple as possible.
        </p>

            <br>
            <p>In brainstorming what design decisions to make for the interface, I chose a simple palette based on a limited array of colors to make the display of information as clean as possible. While the bright colors were implemented to provide contrast for easy viewing accessibility, I also added an underlying, more neutral grey to prevent needless distraction and simplify the visual display. Additionally,
              I incoporated the Rod of Asclepius into the logotype to reflect the pharmaceutical purpose of the service.

              <h3 id='s5' class='section'>HIGH-FIDELITY PROTOTYPING</h3>
              <h2>Addressing and answering the challenges</h2>
              <p>Below are some specific design choices I implemented through the high-fidelity prototypes in order to address the challenges proposed at the beginning of the project. As I began plotting out the interfaces, the main challenge that I encountered was ensuring that I wasn’t compromising functionality for simplicity. Although I wanted to clean up the interface as much as possible, it was equally important that I preserve all the correct steps to help the user go through the whole drug rebate process, from setup to submission.</p><br>

                    <h2>Iterative design and interactive prototyping </h2>
                    <p>Vinerx is still a work in progress, which I am actively working on with the objective of shipping it by the end of the month. Currently, I am in the process of
                    finishing the high-fidelity prototypes of the rebate submission pages (including the forms, files, and claim submission pages). After this,
                    I will submit the interfaces for feedback and work iteratively to change the design according to the needs of the developers and company. Lastly,
                    I will create an interactive prototype to demonstrate how the platform will be used dynamically.</p>
